# Octopus Deploy Demo (ODD)

This solution contains projects to demonstrate how Octopus Deploy works. At the moment the only project is:

* [ODD.Web]

## ODD.Web

Is a .NET Framework 4.x web application. It is a simple startpage with a method that will generate high CPU load. The intention is to be able to show the deployment pipeline 
and to test auto-scaling scenarios.
